# Call of Duty Warzone: Analyzing Projectile Weapons' Success Against Moving Targets in Call of Duty Warzone
* Prior to Call of Duty Warzone 2019 all weapons were hitscan, instantly hitting targets when aimed accurately.
* However, since Call of Duty 2019, players must factor in bullet travel time and potentially lead their targets before firing.
* Created data visualizaions to determine the likelihood of hiting a moving target by simply aiming at centermass at various ranges and bullet velocitys. 

## Function Objectives
* Determine projectile travel times to target at various dinstances
* Various base weapons have specific projectle velocitys
* If a player is running perpendicular to your position, will you hit your target by simply aiming at center mass 

## Procedure
* Loaded Yelp datasets: reviews.csv and restaurants.csv 
* Extracted year from date column and merged the two tables together on business_id
* Created multiple filters and utilized groupby, mean, count, index, and arrays to find average ratings per year and total ratings received and covert them to a dataframe
* Plotted a dual line/bar chart with years on the x-axis and average ratings per year and total ratings per year on the y-axis
* Plotted Subway Stores: Average Ratings by State Through the Years
* Plotted a bar chart with error bars, comparing the mean and standard deviation of ratings for Subway and its national food chain competitors
* Plotted a bar chart with error bars, comparing the mean and standard deviation of ratings for all local vs national food chains
* Plotted a line chart highlighting average ratings by restaurant size
* Plotted an unstacked bar to analyze the number of 1-5 star ratings received from 2018-2021 
* Plotted a rating trend of randomly selected local vs national chain retaurants
* Plotted a bar chart comapring the number of reviews submitted for each star rating
* Plotted a line chart highlighting the number of unique Subway reviewers over the years
* Plotted a bar chart with error bars, comparing the mean and standard deviation of ratings for Subway in each state
